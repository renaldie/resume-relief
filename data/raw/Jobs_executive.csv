台灣聯合動物公園協會本會成立的宗旨即在於宣導尊重生命及愛護動物的觀念，督促政府以人道方式解決流浪動物造成的社會及環境問題，提升台灣國際形象，使動物免於流浪及虐待，直到街上沒有流浪動物為止。協會三大議題包含1.教育推廣中心 2.動物公園貓咪農場建立 3.收容所及愛媽狗園問題為了完成協會三大議題，我們一路堅持三大信念：乾淨：財政透明清楚獨立，不含任何政治色彩，維持公平、公正；溫馨：面對毛小孩們及支持我們的民眾，甚至所有的人，永遠保持最溫暖的心，用愛去關懷整個社會；低調：我們從來不刻意曝光，不刻意追求知名度，販賣同情，有沒有人知道我們，其實並不重要，我們更在乎的是，有沒有把動保這個事情做好，有沒有更多人知道動保這個事情，是我們協會更在乎的事。
